- 👋 Hi, I’m @biffbaff64. I'm a retired C Embedded Software Engineer of @40 years experience.
- 👀 I’m interested in hobyist game development using Java/LibGDX and C#/MonoGame. I'm doing this to keep my brain active, and I enjoy coding.
- 🌱 I'm currently working on a C# conversion of the LibGDX Game Framework, and have Python and BeefLang conversions planned.
- 💞️ I'm open to collaberating on pretty much anything.
- 📫 How to reach me ... email at richikin@gmail.com
